If you are not familiar with Python slicing, it&amp;rsquo;s easier than you think. Imagine you have a list of n items, and you want to get a subset of that list, let&amp;rsquo;s say you want all the items of the original list except for the first one. Python solves the problem in a simple and elegant way.</description></item><item><title>Trying to learn Haskell - List comprehensions</title><link>https://amaccis.github.io/posts/trying-to-learn-haskell-list-comprehensions/</link><pubDate>Sat, 25 Feb 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://amaccis.github.io/posts/trying-to-learn-haskell-list-comprehensions/</guid><description>Every time I tried to learn functional programming, I hated it and I did not achieve any appreciable result. Probably it will go the same way this time too, anyway I thought to give functional programming, and in particular Haskell, one more chance. For this reason I&amp;rsquo;ve just started reading a beautiful book: Learn You a Haskell for Great Good!.
I thought I may write down all the interesting (or weird) things I find out, trying, if possible, to compare them with other things I already know.</description></item></channel></rss>
