Maybe it&amp;rsquo;s a practice you absorb when you program with imperative languages or, somehow you&amp;rsquo;re pushed to think about optimization (iterative algorithms are often faster than recursive ones) or you tell yourself that recursion produces code hard to read, to debug and to maintain, but the fact is that whenever you can apply loops (almost always) you do it.</description></item><item><title>Trying to learn Haskell - List comprehensions</title><link>https://amaccis.github.io/posts/trying-to-learn-haskell-list-comprehensions/</link><pubDate>Sat, 25 Feb 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://amaccis.github.io/posts/trying-to-learn-haskell-list-comprehensions/</guid><description>Every time I tried to learn functional programming, I hated it and I did not achieve any appreciable result. Probably it will go the same way this time too, anyway I thought to give functional programming, and in particular Haskell, one more chance. For this reason I&amp;rsquo;ve just started reading a beautiful book: Learn You a Haskell for Great Good!.
I thought I may write down all the interesting (or weird) things I find out, trying, if possible, to compare them with other things I already know.</description></item></channel></rss>
